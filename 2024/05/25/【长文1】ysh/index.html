<p>Based on the eight psychological types established by Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung, the MBTI applies Jung’s theories in a new practical framework, resulting in the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator.  </p>
<p>The MBTI incorporates Jung’s concepts into four dimensions:  </p>
<p>Direction of Energy: Extraversion (E) versus Introversion (I)  </p>
<p>Way of Gathering Information:  Sensing (S) versus Intuition (N)  </p>
<p>Decision-Making Process:  Thinking (T) versus Feeling (F)  </p>
<p>Approach to the External World : Judging (J) versus Perceiving (P)  </p>
<p>Personality types are determined by selecting one preference from each of the four dimensions, resulting in 16 possible combinations.  </p>
<p>For Social Trend, During the COVID-19 pandemic, the MBTI personality test surged in popularity among South Korea’s youth, who utilized it as an entertaining method to explore potential romantic compatibility. This fascination led to an array of MBTI-themed products, including unique beers, music playlists, and video games designed for different MBTI personality types. The trend escalated to the point where, by December 2021, a survey revealed that nearly half of South Korea’s population had taken the MBTI test. The phenomenon extended into the political sphere, with the MBTI becoming a subject of discussion during the 2022 presidential election in South Korea.  </p>
<p>Compared with Jung’s theory where MBTI came from, MBTI serves more like a simplified version of personality tests. However, returning to a psychological perspective, making complex psychological concepts accessible and applicable to the public inherently lacks strict rigor from a scientific viewpoint.  </p>
<p>Psychometric expert Robert Hogan has characterized the MBTI as essentially an intricate version of a Chinese fortune cookie, suggesting that it is more of an entertaining diversion than a scientifically robust instrument.( Hogan, Robert ,2007) Similarly, Nicholas Campion has described the MBTI as a compelling instance of what he terms ‘disguised astrology,’ implying that it adopts the guise of scientific inquiry to lend itself an air of legitimacy and credibility.( Campion, Nicholas ,2009) Both perspectives convey skepticism towards the MBTI’s standing as a genuine psychological assessment tool. </p>
<p>The controversy on this issue is so great that we have to consider the reliability of mbti from a overall scientific point of view, that is, from the perspective of psychologists.And in my point of view, Although MBTI, as a widely recognized tool, has gained significant influence in popular culture, it lacks credibility from psychological perspective. </p>
<p>Dichotomous scoring method </p>
<p>The first reason why it lacks credibility is that MBTI is its use of a dichotomous scoring method, which would ideally align with a bimodal distribution. This would mean that the majority of people would show a clear preference for one extreme, such as being distinctly extroverted or introverted. However, psychological assessment research has consistently shown that most individuals tend towards a middle ground, exhibiting characteristics that are neither extremely extroverted nor introverted. </p>
<p>In the MBTI scoring system, there is a definitive threshold for each scale, such as the I (introversion) or E (extroversion) scales. Individuals scoring above this threshold are categorized as one type, while those below are categorized as the opposite. Statistically, this implies that the MBTI should exhibit a bimodal distribution, with the majority of people falling into one of two distinct categories, and a minority being ambiguous. </p>
<p>However, A study by McCrae and Costa (1989), published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, provides support for the notion that personality traits are typically distributed along a normal distribution rather than being bimodal. Their research has shown that most individuals fall near the midpoint of personality scales, with fewer individuals at the extreme ends, which contradicts the MBTI’s binary classification method. </p>
<p>Pittenger, David J’s (1993) studies also indicated that on each dimension, it is actually those with middle scores who are most prevalent, resembling a normal distribution. This suggests that the majority of people are, in fact, ambiguous rather than being clearly one type or the other. For instance, Bess, Tammy L.; Harvey, Robert Js’(2002) research has supported that for the introversion&#x2F; extroversion scale, if pure introversion is assigned a score of 0 and pure extroversion a score of 100, the majority of people’s trait scores follow a normal distribution, with approximately 15% of individuals at the low end, 15% at the high end, and 70% in the middle range, not displaying characteristics of being clearly introverted or extroverted. </p>
<p>This distribution is not only supported by experimental data but also aligns with common sense, as human personality traits are often highly integrated. American president Abraham Lincoln has said that “Character is like a tree and reputation like a shadow”. It is also telling us that human’s action are not directly related to the deeper personality because of its complexity. Many individuals can exhibit traits that are seemingly opposite, depending on their emotional state or situation. This complexity of personality suggests that relying on a single type for analysis may be an oversimplification. </p>
<p>Despite these criticisms, proponents(Gu Xueying &amp; Hu Shi,2012; Zhou Min,2022;) of the MBTI argue that the use of a binary method is justified because understanding a person’s general preference for introversion or extroversion, sensing or intuition, is more important than the degree of their preference. They believe that this can help predict an individual’s behavioral responses and is useful for understanding how people, for example, may interact in social settings. Extroverts may be more active in social environments, while introverts might prefer solitude or smaller group interactions. In essence, the MBTI suggests that the direction of preference is more significant than the degree of preference. </p>
<p>It is important to approach the MBTI with a critical eye, recognizing both its utility in providing a broad understanding of personality types and its limitations in capturing the full spectrum of human personality diversity. Other personality frameworks, such as the Big Five personality traits, offer a more nuanced approach to personality assessment, which may provide a more detailed and empirically supported understanding of individual differences. </p>
<p>Test-retest reliability </p>
<p>The second reason why it lacks credibility is that MBTI only have a low test-retest reliability. The consistency of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) across repeated assessments has been found to be relatively weak, with a significant proportion of individuals—ranging from 39% to 76%—receiving different personality type results upon retesting within a short period of five weeks. (Pittenger, David J. 1993)This issue was highlighted in a 2013 piece by Fortune Magazine, which questioned the validity of the MBTI with the headline “Have we all been duped by the Myers-Briggs Test”.( Fortune Magazine,2013) </p>
<p>This phenomenon, is also proved by many other psychologists, Carskadon’s  research shows that within nine months, about 83% of categorizations remain the same when people are retested and after nine months ans around 75%, the questionaire has been changed by (Carskadon, TG &amp; Cook, DD ,1982)Harvey, R J (1996) also did it by nine months, before nine months about 50% remain the same, but after that only 36% remain the same. Myers had tried hard to improve the form of the questions to test but also failed to give it a high retest reliability.(Myers et al. 1998) </p>
<p>However, there is some supportive experiment published on Chinese psychological journal”Applied Psychology”(Cai Huajian, 1998)selected 279 college students and employed the retest strategy after one month and divide the 279 into 9 group in order to avoid some group encounter same great changes, And the experiment turns out to be most group has a high level of consistency. But if we look the experiment clearly and critically. We can easily found that the sample is so small and teenagers especially spent all day long doing their homework even a little change can’t occur in their life, so it is not credible to choose them as the only testers. </p>
<p>Though some supporters are trying to refute, they should aslo notice that The Myers-Briggs Foundation seems to be sidestepping the controversy over the validity of the MBTI, stating outright that the MBTI does not rely on solid theoretical grounding as a selling point but rather starts from the perspective of assisting users. This assistance refers to helping users with self-understanding and self-awareness, rather than predicting job performance. The American researcher Stein believes that the stance of the Myers-Briggs Foundation is contradictory, and he directly criticizes the MBTI for lacking scientific evidence in terms of data and argumentation. </p>
<p>Self-report </p>
<p>The third reason why it lacks credibility is that MBTI reliance on self-reporting opens the door to subjective bias.The accuracy of the MBTI is heavily dependent on the truthfulness of an individual’s self-assessment. Unlike other personality assessments such as the 16PF Questionnaire or the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), the MBTI does not include validity scales designed to detect exaggerated or socially desirable response(Myers, Isabel B.et.al,1998).  </p>
<p>This omission could allow for the potential manipulation of results by those who may have a reason to misrepresent their tendencies (Furnham, A ,1990).For instance, when a person is applying for a position, according to the job description, prefers candidates with a more extroverted personality understanding this preference and wanting to increase their chances of being hired, may feel inclined to adjust their self-assessment on the MBTI to reflect more extroverted traits, even if their natural inclination is towards introversion. the MBTI might ask questions like”Do you prefer  to socialize with a large group of friends or have a small gathering with a few close friends?” Knowing that a more extroverted response could be viewed favorably, The candidates might select the option that aligns with socializing with a large group, regardless of their true preference.(Pittenger, D. J. ,2005; Ashton, M. C., &amp; Lee, K. ,2007)Things like this could lead respondents who are concerned about negative outcomes to provide answers that they perceive as more favorable or acceptable (Myers, Isabel B,1998)That is why we say the self selection bias and the desire for a coherent self image will increase the potential manipulation and decrease its credibility. </p>
<p>Questionaire design </p>
<p>The fourth reason why it lacks credibility is that MBTI has some negative connotation influence. Let’s think at the position of the test-takers. some questions are setted so negative that the testers can’t stand their personality with such an absolute behavior. For instance, consider a question in a personality assessment like the MBTI that reads, “My friends say I am a very calm person.” The options provided for this question might be:”Yes, I am reserved and very calm.””I am more impulsive in speech and action and not calm.”When faced with these choices, some test-takers might be influenced by the slightly negative connotations associated with the words “reserved” and “impulsive,” which could affect their selection. Instead of relying on their initial, gut reaction, they may second-guess their response due to the potential social or personal implications of being seen as “reserved” (which could be interpreted as unsociable or aloof) or “impulsive” (which might be perceived as lacking self-control or being hasty). </p>
<p>This illustrates how the wording of questions and the options provided can introduce bias into the self-reporting process. (Keirsey,1998)Test-takers might not choose the answer that most accurately reflects their true nature because they are swayed by the desire to avoid options with negative implications, even if those options are more truthful descriptors of their behavior. (Sipps, Gary J,2016;) </p>
<p>Beyond the BUzz </p>
<p>Despite the criticisms, MBTI has a multitude of supporters who might argue in favor of its popularity with reasons that could be perceived as somewhat petulant, such as: If you consider the concept unscientific, how do you explain its widespread adoption? Skeptics like to point out a clear commonality between MBTI and astrology—both offer seemingly precise explanations that, upon closer examination, are merely positive descriptions of each personality type. They tell people what they want to hear, thus brainwashing them into believing in its authenticity. This is known in psychology as the “Forer effect,” named after psychologist Bertram Forer who, in 1948, conducted personality tests on students and subsequently provided each with a so-called personalized analysis. The students, who were impressed by the analysis, rated its accuracy at an average of 85%. It was only then that Forer revealed that each student had received the exact same generic report. Believing that the report was tailored specifically for us often inflates our perception of its accuracy.(Bertram Forer ,1948) </p>
<p>This phenomenon, often referred to as the Barnum effect after the famous showman P.T. Barnaum, illustrates how individuals tend to accept vague, positive descriptions as highly accurate reflections of their personality, even when the statements are universally applicable. The Forer effect demonstrates the powerful influence of our desire for personalized feedback, leading us to accept generic statements as uniquely true for us. This cognitive bias can be exploited in various contexts, from astrology readings to personality tests like the MBTI, where the allure of receiving flattering and affirming descriptions can overshadow critical evaluation of the test’s scientific validity. </p>
<p>The popularity of MBTI, therefore, may not necessarily be a testament to its scientific merit but rather to the psychological appeal of receiving feedback that confirms our existing self-perceptions and biases. The test’s widespread acceptance could be attributed to its ability to tap into our innate desire for self-affirmation and its presentation in a manner that is both accessible and reassuring. As such, the MBTI’s enduring presence in popular culture may be more a reflection of these psychological dynamics than of its standing as a rigorous psychometric tool. </p>
<p>Conclusion </p>
<p>But it is worth noting that no theory is perfect in the very begining and mbti has been through a lot of wind and rain since its birth, we can see that there are many improvements made by researchers to mbti in recent years, as well as the changes in its reliability. </p>
<p>Machine Learning got its turn to stand out after the evolution of data in its biggest form, emerging along with data mining and data analysis; it is one of the most popular developments in computational intelligence in the past two decades, so (Justindhas Y1,2022) has made a personality predcition system based on MBTI and machine learning. This had greatly improved the reliability (Sabari Mutheeswari Mohanra,2022)on changing its questions allocation.  </p>
<p>The revision of the original Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) questionnaire has been a subject of interest for enhancing the precision of personality assessment. The updated version of the MBTI aims to improve the clarity and distinctiveness of the questions, thereby reducing ambiguity and increasing the consistency and replicability of the results. This approach is supported by research that emphasizes the importance of question clarity and the reduction of subjective interpretation in personality assessments. </p>
<p>In the context of academic research(NIkki Dale), the revised MBTI questionnaire has been subjected to rigorous testing to ensure its psychometric properties are robust. Studies have focused on the test-retest reliability of the MBTI, which is a crucial indicator of the assessment’s stability over time. According to the research presented in the MBTI Form M Manual Supplement by the Myers-Briggs Foundation, the average test-retest reliability is reported to be 72% over a period of more than a year, which is comparable to or better than other personality tests such as DISC or NEO. </p>
<p>As the article is coming to an end, it’s clear that while the tool has its detractors, its pervasive influence in various domains from personal development to organizational behavior cannot be overlooked. The criticisms aimed at the MBTI’s scientific rigor serve as a crucial reminder that no psychological instrument is without its limitations. It is imperative for practitioners and individuals alike to approach such assessments with a critical eye, recognizing that they are but one piece of a much larger puzzle of self-understanding. Looking ahead, the call for more rigorous validation studies is not a call for the abandonment of the MBTI but rather an opportunity to refine and enhance its utility. </p>
