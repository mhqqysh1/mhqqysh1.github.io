<p>MBTI: Good For Mental Health?  </p>
<p>Have you ever taken an MBTI personality test or something alike? If so, what do you think of it? </p>
<p>Established in the 1940s, MBTI has taken advantage of the Internet and become popular around the world. It not only attracts people from all over the world to take the test, but also triggers recreation among teenagers. Within only China’s social platform, topics related to “MBTI” and “MBTI memes” have more than 2 billion reads and more than 900,000 comments. This popularity occurs mainly within teenage groups and has been widely criticized for various reasons like unreliability or misleading. However, after going through pages of reviews written by peer takers, I still believe that MBTI makes sense and does more good than bad on teenagers’ mental health.  </p>
<p>Current studies have found that high ego identity inspired by MBTI benefits adolescent mental health. And as a MBTI test taker myself, it has helped me a lot in exploring myself, let alone the fact that the online MBTI community has taught me that there exist people who think like me. So, although many people criticize MBTI tests and its correlated communities on the perspectives that involve inaccuracy, self-labeling, stereotypes and stigmatization, I still believe that it does more good than bad on teenagers’ mental health, if used properly. </p>
<p>It is said that “When it comes to MBTI tests, it’s either believing or not taking.” However, this is usually not the case. With popularity comes a heated discussion on whether MBTI deserves its fame. Within all those voices exist many that criticize MBTI test for various reasons. </p>
<p>Among the wide criticism people put on MBTI personality tests, the reliability of the tests counts a lot. On the one hand, some people believe that personality tests have ambiguous judging standards and perform weakly in describing the personalities of people. They claim that “the questions are confusingly worded, thus making it difficult to know whether people are interpreting the questions in the ways they were intended.”  On the other hand, many people hold the opinion that personality tests “tell you what you tell them”, or describes what every human being is like. (Gorman &amp; Gorman, 2022) Additionally, the theory lying behind MBTI test is also questioned. As Jim Butcher, an emeritus psychologist at the University of Minnesota puts it, “The problem with practically all of the assessments at the time was that they were built on the creators’ subjective feelings about personality”. They believe that the concept of “personality tests” is itself unacceptable. </p>
<p>For those who have already taken the test, problems are raised again. People argue that personality test results cause self-labeling and underprediction about how different people will be in the future. “Labeling is problematic because we think the label we give ourselves is predictive of the future. But we usually underpredict how different we’ll be in the future.”(Snow, 2020) ”.  When personality tests give out a result, it changes our self-cognition. We tend to limit ourselves within the walls of existing identity labels. As a result, we get trapped in these labels we put on ourselves most of the time and thus prevent ourselves from growing. </p>
<p>What’s more, people worry that different characteristics of personality types might bring stigmatization among people. As raised by Shiyao Li, descriptions of different MBTI types become labels for them, forming fixed, general stereotypes about different personality types. “As an ‘objective scientific’ personality test, the MBTI personality classification produces a certain ranking in which people may tend to be more focused on intelligent personalities, or more sociable and popular personalities.”(Li, 2023) They believe that this will cause bad effects on teenagers’ mental health. </p>
<p>Though it is necessary to admit that MBTI test does have flaws within itself, how they can be transformed into beneficial things and what it is able to achieve is more worth highlighting. </p>
<p>A common aspect MBTI tests are criticized for is its reliability. If we type in “MBTI” to a searching engine, what might appear below, except for the official “16 personalities” website, are chains of articles with titles like “How accurate are MBTI tests?” or “Stop taking MBTI tests from now”. It seems that the inaccuracy of MBTI test is a widely accepted fact.  </p>
<p>Most of the questioning on the reliability of MBTI is based on theories. For example, as Adam Grant, a professor of industrial psychology at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, wrote in his essay, “In social science, we use four standards. For the MBTI, the evidence says not very, no, no and not really.”(Yancey-Bragg, 2019) Or as Hardy has said, “Psychologists have gone as far as saying that type-based personality profiles are no more scientific than horoscopes.”(Benjamin, 2020) The keyword “science” keeps popping up. However, is single science enough to judge the reliability of something related to psychology? If so, how do we explain the positive remarks made by test takers? </p>
<p>“It feels wonderful to read a personality analysis that manages to capture the essence of who we are” </p>
<p>“As I’m reading this, I’m thinking ‘wow, this is basically me under the microscope and more’” </p>
<p>Comments like these keep appearing under the MBTI official websites. However, most of the articles I could find doubt about this. If we recap on how people say negatively about the reliability of MBTI tests, we can see that they often stop at arguing that MBTI is scientifically unreliable before digging into how it is so. This raises my doubt about whether these arguments are reliable enough. </p>
<p>Scientifically, we can go back to the theoretical root of MBTI and find some support for its reliability. As explained by the official website 16personalities, MBTI is “based on five distinct and independent scales which are internally consistent” and that “people who retake the assessment are very likely to get similar scores on all scales.”(Reliability and Validity | 16Personalities, n.d.) This argument is based on statistic research and is concluded from a large number of samples. The MBTI test uses a NERIS® model, which is based on the Jungian model and rebalanced to achieve higher accuracy. Raised in the early 20th century, Jung’s theory of psychological types is one of the most influential creations in personality typology, which adds to the reliability of MBTI tests. </p>
<p>What’s more, when it comes to the impact MBTI tests have on teenagers’ mental health, researchers have found that online personality tests promote self-cognition of teenagers, build connections between people, and create senses of belonging. One characteristic shared by all popular culture is that they create community and bonding between people. The culture of MBTI tests, by itself, helps people gain deeper knowledge about themselves and sort people into different groups by their personality types. As explained by Zhang in his research paper, “Users participate in online MBTI groups out of their desire for handling identity cognition, seeking understanding and self-development.” (Zhang, 2023) Online MBTI groups provide users with opportunities to understand themselves, to connect with others and to realize the unity of “social self” and “ideal self”. After taking the test, users’ MBTI results become the start of their self-cognition, which may eventually help them to further learn about who they are and who they want to become. </p>
<p>Born as GenZ kids, we grew up along with the development of the internet and went through the Covid years during a time when our self-cognition should have been well-developed. Just as Li said in her research, “Young people who stand at the crossroads of life choices often pin their uncertainty on horoscopes and even religious beliefs.”(Li, 2023) However, loss of self-cognition isn’t the only thing that is troubling us. Spending much of our leisure time online, we type more than we speak, we play video games more than we play sports, and we see webpages more frequently than we meet our friends. This situation has lasted so long that we have become isolated from our peers. Our generation feels interpersonal loneliness more often than previous generations do. And our process of self-cognition is deeply affected by the presence of the internet. </p>
<p>According to researchers, teenagers are now having less face-to-face interaction with people in real life. Instead, there appears a potential that it is going to be replaced by online interaction.(Daria, 2011) The absence of real-life interaction can easily cause mental problems among teenagers and make them feel lost. When trying to figure out the questions of “who I am” and “who I want to be”, feeling lost can be quite a lot of misery for teenagers. The communities created by MBTI culture, in this case, provide teenagers with a shelter in which they feel belonged, cared for, and understood, and thus, reduce the anxiety brought by loss of identity. Inside those shelters, people with the same personality types share their feelings of life and give advice to people who are having troubles. Users empathize with others and feel empathized through sharing what isn’t commonly understood by their real-life peers. “By empathizing and spreading similar emotions, users complete their construction of self-identity and group identity.” (Zhang, 2023) In this way, teenagers gain the courage to face their real-life crisis and accept themselves more.  </p>
<p>Specifically, MBTI communities also provide minority groups with a safe place to build their self-cognition and to speak for themselves. For example, what this minor community has done is that it made being homosexual or bisexual a less awkward thing to say. As found by Ding, “Lesbians and bisexuals make up a proportion of the MBTI’s online community, and in this group, they are willing to be open about their sexual minority identity and actively share their emotional experiences, regardless of their own happiness or trauma.”(Ding, 2023) Considering the LGBTQ+ community and people with depression, the popularity of personality tests makes minority groups feel safer and understood. Additionally, online MBTI interest groups are also good places where people with depression express themselves and feel understood. As mentioned by Ding, current medical systems can provide medical treatment for people with depression, but it cannot provide emotional empathy, let alone emotional connection. In this case, patients find it hard to build emtional connections with someone they could rely on, which is why they have turned to online virtual communities. </p>
<p>Overall, the popularity of MBTI tests has increased subjective well-being levels and reduce anxiety and depression of teenagers in the big picture.(Jie &amp; Yixin, 2023) It not only promotes self-cognition in teenagers, but also builds connections between people and helps them create senses of belonging. In this way, MBTI tests are able to find their way to improving the mental health of teenagers. </p>
<p>Additionally, online MBTI communities also give people ideal personality types and help teenagers find their ideal lifestyles. When users are given their own personality types, they could also see what other personality types are like. By exploring, learning, and understanding, people could find out what their ideal lifestyle is like. With this in mind, teenagers can grasp a clearer perspective of how they want their future to be.  </p>
<p>According to Ding, “Members of the community who have a deeper understanding of the MBTI system will point to self-improvement as an important reason why they started learning about MBTI and chose to go deeper into it.” (Ding, 2023) The personality types that MBTI groups understand and create in the interaction provide a more typical and idealized personality type on the basis of the original type. Zhang also mentioned in his essay that “The description for MBTI types is mostly positive. This gives users a possible view of what their life could be like, thus it promotes self-development.”(Zhang, 2023) A lot of researches prove that the method of separating and defining personalities as different types helps form ideal lifestyles in teenagers‘ minds. </p>
<p>However, one thing worth mentioning is that while MBTI tests help people understand themselves better, we must keep in mind that it can be quite misleading if one relies too much on it. Anyhow, it’s just a matter of recreation, not something to be taken too seriously. Being too dependent on this kind of test might lead to the problem of self-labeling. Thus, placing a proper amount of attention to MBTI test, not ignoring it altogether while not relying too much on it, is probably the healthiest way to interact with this personality test under hot debate. </p>
<p>All in all, if understood and used in a proper way, MBTI personality test can be a good tool for teenagers to understand themselves, build connections, find their senses of belonging and find their ideal lifestyles. Though, objectively, there exists some flaws in its testing method and might lead people to misuse it, it is the users’ responsibility to decide how much they rely on it. While the test itself is not a perfect thing, its educating and healing powers outweigh its imperfection. For teenagers born in the era of the internet and having experienced Covid-19 period, the MBTI tests are good, though not perfect, ways to build our self-cognition and to connect with people. Living in a time of loneliness and isolation, MBTI tests can be a cure and director on our way to understanding ourselves. </p>
<p>What teenagers need to keep in mind, in all, is to be critical and objective when referring to the MBTI test results. View them as suggestions in life and find your own lifestyle with the help of it.  Only in this way could we make the advantages of the MBTI tests shine through. </p>
