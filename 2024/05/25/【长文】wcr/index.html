                <p>Alarm to the drawbacks of MBTI’s stereotypes’ popularity. </p>
<p>Nowadays, MBTI becomes very popular in the community of young people. The MBTI was created by Isabel Briggs Myers and her mother, Katherine Briggs in the early l940s as a test to be used for personnel selection. (Pittenger, 1993) MBTI divided people into 16 types and each type consists 4 characters which are “E” or “I” represents Extroversion and Introversion, “S” or “N” represents Sensing and Intuition, “T” or “F” represents Thinking and Feeling, “J” or “N” represents Judgment and Perception. The four characters show the preference of one aspects of personality. Since people’s interaction is being more and more frequent online, MBTI became a good way to know about each other and it is also an interesting thing to know how you are. So, MBTI test become popular online and soon develops into the real world in China. MBTI’s popularity brings many advantages like gain recognition from a community formed by the same MBTI, or people can realize more about themselves and others. But at the same time, many problems appeared, too. As MBTI become a popularity in internet, people create medias using MBTI like the label of themselves and others in an entertaining way. In this way MBTI’s specific descriptions are getting deeper in audiences’ mind, which forms stereotypes. MBTI’s stereotypes’ popularity causes some problems in self-perception and judgment of others. So, in the following part I would like to analyze accuracy of MBTI’s stereotypes and the drawbacks of MBTI’s stereotypes popularity. </p>
<p>MBTI is a kind of test that analyze your personality by asking some questions. Maybe it will ask that “which one will you choose when you decide to hang out for fun, planning to do something or having a trip without plan” or “you would more like to be a kind person or a capable person”. This test has some accuracy because most of the questions based on people’s actions they will do or what kind of person they want to be. It relates to your values which will determine the personality to some extent. Also, it has a value of reference because it divides four kinds of personality into two parts, which can show one person’s character in a general correct description from four aspects. Correlations of subjects’ raw scores of the eight preference poles of the MBTI scales indicated strong negative relationships (r &lt; –.84) between the dichotomous poles of each MBTI dimension. (Randall et al., 2024) This evidence can show its validity. </p>
<p>However, MBTI is not exactly accurate due to its theoretical mechanism. MBTI divides one kind of character into two parts, like I and E, T and F. The letters in the MBTI only show one’s preference between those two but not reflect the level of preference, which will cause inaccuracy. In reality, human character is not either-or, but has complexity, such as I and E people also have degrees, some people are partial to I, and some people are partial to E. (Xia, 2024) because of the mechanism that only judge people’s character by two extremes, many people’s MBTI can’t show the whole image of them. Also, there is a phenomenon that someone who tests more than one time in a short period will find that his MBTI changes as many times as he did the tests. Typically, the test-retest interval can range from several weeks to more than a year. Because type is said to be a constant characteristic, we would expect that people’s personality would not change over time. Several studies, however, show that even when the test-retest interval is short (e.g., 5 weeks), as many as 50 percent of the people will be classified into a different type. (Pittenger, 1993) Though it’s normal that people’s personality will change, but it usually takes a long time other than in just one month. This can indicate that MBTI is not a steady result that can show people’s image. </p>
<p>Although MBTI is not totally precise in a scientific sense, many descriptions of MBTI truly make people feel the same in some aspects and gain a sense of belonging. In that case, MBTI gets more and more popular through getting the recognition of people. as MBTI come into public view, many media creators create thousands of works about it, in which most of them are based on the stereotypes. This kind of phenomenon not only bring us entertainment but also affect ourselves’ image towards people through using MBTI.  </p>
<p>As MBTI test become more and more popular among young people, many people who know their MBTI will surf online to see how their MBTI show themselves. When they see some memes or some videos which show the character of their MBTI, it’s normal to compare themselves to the descriptions they see. While, most of the popular memes and videos online emphasize the stereotype of MBTI, like “I” means social anxiety disorder, “E” means social butterfly. According to Barnum effect, It is easy for people to be hinted by external information, resulting in the deviation of self-perception. (J. Qin et al., 2023) During the time they compare themselves with those stereotypes, they will feel a sense of recognition when they find the similarities. This kind of feeling will make people believe what MBTI says more, thus, make people label themselves as the stereotype of their MBTI. This can cause two bad influences in effecting self-image. One is that people will be more and more close to the stereotype of his MBTI although they are not totally the same as it, no matter the stereotype is good or bad. For example, the test indicates that ENFP will be less concentrated in doing things, videos and memes will label this point as ENFP. Through watching these on the internet, people who is ENFP will have a kind of psychological suggestions that he should be the same as the stereotype says, so ENFPs will be closer to a less-concentrated person instead of improving their concentration. (J. Qin et al., 2023) Also, due to MBTI’s popularity and signifying, many groups divided by MBTI are formed. Some will choose to make themselves to be closer to the common image of a specific MBTI to gain recognition and a sense of belonging from the groups. When people exchange personality cards online and offline and get to know each other, they also actively carry out impression decoration, and strive to make external self-expression consistent with their personality type, in order to integrate into the group or leave a deep impression on others. (X. Qin &amp; Wang, 2024) This kind of influence is potential because it permeates in the daily entertainment and social contact. As MBTI’s stereotype become a type of pastime, it’s hard to find that it truly has a great influence on everyone. This is the reason why we should alarm it. The other is that people will be unwilling to improve themselves because they think that MBTI shows a fixed personality they have and can’t be change. Some individuals choose not to act or change after they have made clear the shortcomings or defects in their personality, and MBTI becomes an excuse for them to “accept their fate” and “put away”. (X. Qin &amp; Wang, 2024) Some people focus on the shorts it shows and being self-abased about them. for instance, INFPs see their MBTI is being described as a over sensitive and being despised group, some will become self-loathing and lack of confidence. Some will use their MBTI labels as a shield to make excuses for some of their actions. Like in MBTI, T is considered as a person with thinking more than feeling. For some people in Ts, they think it’s normal to be selfish and unable to understand people’s feeling because they are Ts. They are proud of their selfish and hurt others without regret. This kind of situations all show that MBTI’s stereotypes make some people misinterpret or limit their self-image, which is a trouble for both self and others. </p>
<p>MBTI‘s stereotype popularity not only affect people’s self-image, but also influence people’s view towards others with other MBTI. MBTI can provide stereotype in two ways. One is through media. When we know your MBTI and search online for our own MBTI, we probably see some description of other MBTI because most videos and articles about MBTI don’t just introduce one type of MBTI. Our curiosity drives us to grab the information of other MBTI, especially for MBTI that our friends and family have, we will be more willing to know about their MBTI and pay more attention to them. In this way, the stereotype of other MBTI which media shows will also be put in our mind. What strengthen the influence for this kind of situation is that for the comments under those medias who spread the stereotype, most of them are providing agreement, which will make people convince more. The other is through the real-life experience. When we interact with people with different MBTI around, their behavior will be considered as the representation of their MBTI. Thus, as we get in touch with more an more people in the same MBTI, we will put the common actions in them in the stereotype of MBTI. These two reasons can all cause stereotypes of a specific MBTI. As MBTI become more and more popular, people like to know each other through MBTI. When you know about others’ MBTI, the stereotype of them come into your mind and apply them to others. For example, when you meet a people who is ESTJ, you will probably think he is a strict, conservative and self-disciplined person, which is described as a typical of “Chinese parent” that makes people feel difficult to contact. In that case, we might ignore the true image of the person himself but focus on the image provided by his MBTI. In a word, MBTI limit the image we think about others in a form of preconceptions to provide first impression, which is hard to change, whatever persons actually do afterwards. This can cause many troubles on interpersonal relationship. Firstly, it can make people misunderstand others. For example, INFP’s stereotype is an extremely sensitive and self-abased person who always immerses himself in sorrow. Most people won’t like to be friends with such a person that seems to always bring negative energy to you. When you meet a INFP in the real world, you’d like to put this kind of label on the person and subconsciously keep away from him, although if you know more about him you would find out that he is not the person you think. In this kind of situation, MBTI’s stereotypes prevent we from making a correct and objective judgement about others. Some bad label will cause a misunderstanding on the persons who are actually better than you think, just like when you like to believe a good-looking person more than an ugly person. Worse still, it will lead to a chain of contempt. In the public eye, “T” is better than “F” because “T” represents thinking, which seems to be clever than “F”. no matter on the internet or in real life, “T” has a sense of superiority over “F” because they think they are more logical and not easily governed by emotions. But it doesn’t mean that “F” is not sane. “F” can better perceive others’ feelings and be more compassionate, which is more important in interpersonal relationship and team work. Such case is not uncommon. “N” is better than “S” because people in “N” is more creative, “P” is better than “J” because people with “P” can have more flexibility. But we also need to learn from our experiences which people in “S” is better at because it can provide a relatively correct reference. we also need people to lay out a regulation and do the plan to make the world revolve in order. Every personality should be an obbligato part of the world and there should be no prejudice on the characters that in your subjectivity is not good.  </p>
<p>In fact, MBTI is created to be an effective tool to know about ourselves and others. But when MBTI become the only label of people’s characters, MBTI has already run counter to its original purpose. The stereotypes cause a bias in self-perceptions, a misunderstanding in others and prejudice between people in different MBTI. So, to solve these problems, first we should begin with ourselves. Most of these problems are mainly because they take MBTI as an absolute standard so they can’t differentiate the differences between the stereotype of a MBTI and the real personality of a person in MBTI. People who are interested in MBTI should enrich their knowledge about MBTI but not limit their perception in the memes and videos that spreading stereotypes. Only by enriching and improving my own knowledge framework can I form a more scientific understanding of various psychological tests. On the Internet where various psychological memes are prevalent, I will not be confused by entertaining and misleading content and find the right path for my growth. (J. Qin et al., 2023) Only if we do better to truly know the MBTI can we not be misled by the creation of excessive entertaining. At the same time, we should make use of our MBTI to know about our drawbacks of personality and correct ourselves to be better. Also, when we create related works about MBTI, we should keep a fine line between science and entertainment. The prevalence of Internet memes is the expression of the active participation of netizens in the creation of Internet content, but the creation should also pay attention to discrimination. This is not conducive to the subsequent correct self-cognition, and will actively label and simplify themselves. (Zhao, 2022) So in that case we consciously show that although MBTI can concrete your image, but everyone has a unique personality. In the process of creating and disseminating memes, such text like “Represents only me this MBTI” can be consciously added so that the audience of the meme is aware of defining the personality in terms of the individual, rather than having the personality define the individual. (J. Qin et al., 2023) No matter we are the creators or audiences, we should keep a cool head that MBTI is just a reference that doesn’t totally represent one’s own image, reduce identity confusion and anxiety, and create our own unique value and positioning.  </p>
<p>In all, The MBTI test is widely used by young people as a tool to help people understand themselves, and thus the stereotypes of MBTI have been widely spread among young people. The popularity of MBTI’s stereotypes is essentially due to the fact that it fits into the mentality of young people seeking identity and is fueled by Internet pop culture. But stereotypes have their limitation and affect people’s self-image and others’ images. So as a member of young people, we should aware of the bad influence of MBTI’s stereotypes to avoid being the sufferer or the spreader, actively develop their own uniqueness and view ourselves from a dynamic perspective. For the extra things, since this article is mostly explaining things by theory analyzing, more data online about surveying the effect of MBTI’s stereotypes can be included in the future. </p>
